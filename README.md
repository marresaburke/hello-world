# hello-world
Hi there, I am a news reporter who views data as a tool to tell more meaningful stories. 

In each repository, I aim to explore datasets and find the stories that lie beneath the surface. In engaging with my code, I hope you consider what data is needed to shed light on an issue facing you or your community. 

It all starts with a question and desire to look for what's there.
