# hello-world
A place where brilliance is stored 
I ask this question often, yet it is hard to answer. Who am I? What makes me different? 
To start I have a pet turtle who captures my true personality. Unbothered. I like to be alone, but that's not the version of me that people see. I love bold colors and being unapologetically me. 
I care about others and what's important in their lives. 
I believe in challenging myself and that I am in control of my own happiness.
